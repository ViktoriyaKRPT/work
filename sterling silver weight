# Define the volume of the sterling silver product (in cm³)
volume = 10  # Example volume

# Sterling silver density (in g/cm³)
density = 10.5

# Calculate the weight of the sterling silver product
weight = volume * density

# Print the result
print("The weight of the sterling silver product is", weight, "grams.")
